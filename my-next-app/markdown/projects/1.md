# Project Overview

This study develops three deployable tiny machine learning models for the detection of three types of epeleptic seizures: _Absence, Tonic-Clonic, and Generalised Non-Specific._ The models were trained on an open seizure dataset collected by Temple University [[view](https://isip.piconepress.com/projects/nedc/html/tuh_eeg/#i_rsyn)].

## Technologies

-   **Hardware:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
-   **Core Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite, MNE Python

## Methodology

The study focused on developing three individual models designed to detect one seizure. This produced three models in a model-per-seizure approach. To allow for deployment, the models were first developed with PyTorch and then converted to TensorFlow Lite to produce MCU-compatible models with full-integer quantisation.

To summarise the development process, the study was divided into three main stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The raw EEG data was preprocessed using MNE Python. A simplified and trainable representation was then produced with Melspectrograms, allowing for suitable image-based input for the models. Three datasets were produced, each containing the data for one seizure type.
2. **Model Development:** Three CNN models were developed using PyTorch and trained on the datasets.
3. **Model Deployment:** The models were converted to TFLite and deployed on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. The models were tested on the device to ensure deployment success.
